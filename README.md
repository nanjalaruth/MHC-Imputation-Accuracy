## Greetings!!
### So excited to have you here!!

## Project description
Genotype imputation refers to the statistical inference of unobserved genotypes.

This project focused on assessing the accuracy of __imputation tools__ ([SNP2HLA](http://software.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snp2hla/) and [HIBAG](https://github.com/zhengxwen/HIBAG)), __reference panels__(1kg-All, 1kg-Gwd, 1kg-Afr, H3Africa) and __genotyping arrays__ (Illumina Omni 2.5 array, H3Africa array) used for imputation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in selected African populations. 

The HLA region has been associated to *autoimmune* diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and *infectious diseases* such as HIV/AIDS. Accurate imputation of this highly polymorphic region would increase the chances of identifying the causal variants of some autoimmune and immune mediated diseases.
