# MHC-Imputation-Accuracy

## Greetings!!
### So excited to have you here!!

## Project description
Genotype imputation refers to the statistical inference of unobserved genotypes.

This project focusses on assessing the accuracy of imputation tools, reference panels and genotyping arrays used for imputation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region in selected African populations. The human Major histocompatibility Complex region also referred to as the HLA region has been associated to autoimmune and immune mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Accurate imputation of this highly polymorphic region would increase the chances of identifying the causal variants of some autoimmune and immune mediated diseases.
